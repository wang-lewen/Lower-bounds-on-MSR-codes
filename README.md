**Lower Bounds on the Sub-Packetization of Optimal-Access MSR Codes for Multiple-Node Repair**

`Authors:` Lewen Wang, Zihao Zhang, Sihuang Hu

`Abstract:`We establish lower bounds on the sub-packetization of optimal-access MSR codes in the context of multiple-node failures. 
These bounds generalize the tight bounds for single-node failure presented by Balaji~\emph{et al.} (IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 68, no. 10, 2022). 
Moreover, we utilize generating functions to provide a more refined analysis, further strengthening these bounds.
